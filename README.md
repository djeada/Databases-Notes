# Databases
This repository is a helpful guide for anyone working with data. It covers everything you need to know about databases, including SQL and NoSQL databases, making them faster, and keeping them secure. It also has real-world examples to help you understand how to use databases in practice.

## Motivation

I created this repository to help myself and others overcome database challenges and build reliable, high-performance data systems. Throughout my career, I've faced numerous database issues, including slow SQL queries and poorly optimized tables. I realized that having a deep understanding of databases is essential for creating effective data systems.

To improve my skills and tackle these challenges, I decided to create a comprehensive guide to databases. I've included essential concepts, tools, and real-world case studies to provide a well-rounded understanding of database engineering. 

## How to Setup a Database

Setting up a database can be a challenging task, especially if you're new to databases. However, to make it easier, here are a few helpful resources:

Sql interpreters online:

* https://sqliteonline.com/
* https://www.sql-practice.com/
* http://sqlforever.com/
* https://dbfiddle.uk/

Sample Databases:

* https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sample_Databases

These online SQL interpreters allow you to test SQL queries without the need for any local installation, making it easy to get started. The sample databases provide a useful starting point for testing and exploring different database systems.
