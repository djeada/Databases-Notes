## Databases Intro

Databases are essential components in modern software applications. They are used to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. Understanding their purpose and use is crucial for backend engineers to build scalable and high-performing applications.

##  Purpose of Databases

- Organizing Data: Databases offer a structured method for arranging and storing data, streamlining management and maintenance.

- Maintaining Data Integrity: Guarantee data accuracy, consistency, and validity via constraints, relationships, and transactions.

- Ensuring Data Security: Apply user access controls, encryption, and backup strategies to safeguard sensitive information.

- Providing Data Availability: Ensure high availability and dependability to fulfill application requirements and reduce downtime.

- Enhancing Data Performance: Optimize data access and modification processes for superior performance and low latency.

- Swift Searches: Facilitate rapid data search and retrieval.

- Data Remixing: Simplify data combination and manipulation.

- Efficient Data Calculations: Execute calculations on data effectively.

- Seamless Import and Export: Integrate smoothly with other applications.

## Components of Databases

- Tables: Arrange data in a structured manner using rows (records) and columns (fields).

- SQL: An extensive language for querying databases, featuring six fundamental operations (select, join, filter, append, aggregate, sort).

- Aggregation: Merge rows using functions like min, max, avg, sum, count, etc.

- Filtering: Employ the "where" keyword to refine data based on specific conditions.

## Why Use a Database Server?

- Managing Relationships: Oversee relationships between tables, updating, deleting, or inserting data depending on the relationship and action.

- Transactional Integrity: Ensure all modifications are executed simultaneously and reliably, even in the event of a crash.

- Efficient Data Storage: Optimize data storage methods.

- Parsing Complex Queries: Accommodate a wide range of functionality by parsing intricate queries that involve multiple tables.

- Query Optimization: Refine suboptimal queries to boost performance.

- Authentication: Oversee user authentication and access control.

- Improved Speed: Enhance data retrieval and manipulation rates compared to conventional spreadsheets.
