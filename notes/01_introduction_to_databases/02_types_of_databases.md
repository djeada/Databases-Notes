# Overview of Database Types

Databases are essential tools that store, organize, and manage data for various applications. They come in different types, each designed to handle specific data models and use cases. Understanding the various database types helps in selecting the right one for your application's needs. Let's delve into the major types of databases and explore their characteristics, strengths, and suitable applications.

## Relational Databases (RDBMS)

Relational databases store data in structured tables consisting of rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. Each table represents an entity, and relationships between tables are established through keys. This structured approach enforces data integrity and allows for complex queries using Structured Query Language (SQL).

Imagine a simple online store database:

```
+------------------+          +--------------------+
|     Customers    |          |       Orders       |
+------------------+          +--------------------+
| CustomerID       |          | OrderID            |
| Name             |          | CustomerID         |
| Email            |          | OrderDate          |
+------------------+          +--------------------+
| 1 | Alice Smith  |          | 101 | 1 | 2023-01-15|
| 2 | Bob Johnson  |          | 102 | 2 | 2023-01-16|
+------------------+          +--------------------+
```

In this example, the `Customers` table holds customer information, while the `Orders` table records customer orders. The `CustomerID` in the `Orders` table links each order to a customer, establishing a relationship.

- **Scalability constraints can arise** in relational databases, as vertical scaling often becomes costly and has practical limits.  
- **Rigid schemas pose challenges** when adapting to changes, making modifications to data models cumbersome and time-consuming.  
- The **performance of relational databases** may degrade when managing large volumes of unstructured data, impacting efficiency.  

## NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases provide flexible schemas and are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. They are categorized into several types, each optimized for specific data models and access patterns.

### Document-Based Databases

Document-based databases store data as documents, often using JSON-like formats. Each document contains data and metadata, allowing for nested structures and varying fields across documents.

Consider a user database:

```
{
  "userID": "1",
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "orders": [
    {"orderID": "101", "amount": 250.00},
    {"orderID": "103", "amount": 125.50}
  ]
}

{
  "userID": "2",
  "name": "Bob Johnson",
  "email": "bob@example.com",
  "orders": [
    {"orderID": "102", "amount": 300.00}
  ]
}
```

Here, each user document includes an array of orders, showcasing the flexibility of nesting data.

### Key-Value Databases

Key-value databases are the simplest type of NoSQL databases, storing data as key-value pairs. They offer fast performance for applications requiring frequent reads and writes.

An example of a session store:

```
"session1234": { "userID": "1", "loginTime": "2023-01-15T10:00:00Z" }
"session5678": { "userID": "2", "loginTime": "2023-01-16T11:30:00Z" }
```

Each session ID maps directly to the session data.

#### Representative Systems

- **Redis**
- **Amazon DynamoDB (can also function as a document store)**
- **Riak**

#### Use Cases and Strengths

### Column-Based Databases

Column-based databases, also known as wide-column stores, organize data into columns and rows but allow for flexible schemas where each row can have different columns.

Visualizing a time-series data storage:

```
Row Key: sensor1
---------------------------
| timestamp      | value  |
---------------------------
| 2023-01-15T10:00 | 20.5 |
| 2023-01-15T10:05 | 21.0 |
| 2023-01-15T10:10 | 20.8 |

Row Key: sensor2
---------------------------
| timestamp      | value  |
---------------------------
| 2023-01-15T10:00 | 18.2 |
| 2023-01-15T10:05 | 18.5 |
| 2023-01-15T10:10 | 18.3 |
```

Each row represents a sensor, and columns store readings over time.

### Graph Databases

Graph databases focus on relationships between data points, representing data as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships). They are powerful for applications where understanding and traversing relationships is crucial.

An example representing social connections:

```
[User: Alice]
    |
[FRIENDS_WITH]
    |
[User: Bob]
    |
[LIKES]
    |
