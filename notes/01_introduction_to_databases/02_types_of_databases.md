## Relational Databases (RDBMS)
Relational databases, also known as Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), are structured databases that leverage a set of tables for data storage. Each table contains data in rows and columns, with unique keys used for identifying each row. These databases rigidly adhere to a predefined schema that determines the structure and types of data stored.

## Representative Systems
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle Database
- Microsoft SQL Server

## Use Cases
- Transaction processing systems
- Enterprise applications
- Any system where data consistency and integrity are of high importance

## Strengths
- ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties ensuring data reliability
- Strong support for structured data and complex queries
- Enforced data consistency due to adherence to schema

## Weaknesses
- Limited scalability, especially horizontal scaling
- Rigidity in data structure, leading to difficulties in handling unstructured data
- Performance can be an issue with large and complex databases

## NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that allow for the storage and retrieval of data in ways that don't follow the tabular relations used in relational databases.

## NoSQL Document-Based Databases

Document-based databases store and manage data as documents, often using human-readable formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or BSON (Binary JSON).

## Representative Systems
- MongoDB
- Couchbase

## Use Cases
- Content management systems
- Catalog management
- Real-time analytics and high-speed logging, caching, and high scalability applications

## Strengths
- High flexibility due to lack of schema
- High performance and easy to scale
- Excellent fit for hierarchical data storage

## Weaknesses
- Limited support for complex transactions involving multiple operations
- Inefficient for complex queries and joins

## NoSQL Column-Based Databases
Column-based databases, also known as wide-column stores, organize data by columns instead of rows. They are designed for scaling and for reading and writing large datasets.

## Representative Systems
- Apache Cassandra
- Google Cloud Bigtable
- Apache HBase

## Use Cases
- Time series data
- Big Data processing
- Real-time processing of large-scale data

## Strengths
- High performance for reads and writes, especially with large amounts of data
- Efficient storage and retrieval of columnar data
- Scalability and fault-tolerance

## Weaknesses
- Not designed for complex queries involving multiple tables
- Learning curve for those accustomed to SQL-based systems

## NoSQL Key-Value Databases
Key-value databases are simple, efficient, and highly scalable NoSQL databases that store data as key-value pairs.

## Representative Systems
- Redis
- Amazon DynamoDB

## Use Cases
- Caching
- Session management
- User preference storage

## Strengths
- Simple and efficient data storage and retrieval
- High performance and easy to scale
- Can handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads

## Weaknesses
- Limited support for complex queries
- Lack of structure can lead to challenges in data management

## NoSQL Graph-Based Databases
Graph databases store and manage data as nodes and edges, representing entities and their relationships, respectively.

## Representative Systems
- Neo4j
- Amazon Neptune

## Use Cases
- Social networks
- Recommendation engines
- Fraud detection systems

## Strengths
- Efficient handling of relationship-heavy data
- Powerful graph traversal queries
- More intuitive modeling for certain types of data

## Weaknesses
- Requires different mindset than traditional SQL databases
- Limited support for operations that aren't related to graph traversal
- May be less efficient for handling non-graph related operations
