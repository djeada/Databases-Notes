## Database Management Systems (DBMS)

Database Management Systems (DBMS) as the name suggests manage the databases, additionally they store, and manipulate data. Understanding the various types of DBMS is essential for backend engineers to make informed decisions when designing and implementing data management solutions.

## Types of Database Management Systems (DBMS)

### A. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

- **Overview:** RDBMS is grounded in the relational model and utilizes SQL as its main query language.
- **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
- **Characteristics:** Tables, columns, rows, keys, ACID properties, schema, and robust consistency.

### B. Object-Oriented Database Management System (OODBMS)

- **Overview:** OODBMS fuses database and object-oriented programming concepts, permitting data storage as objects.
- **Examples:** ObjectDB, db4o, and Versant Object Database.
- **Characteristics:** Object persistence, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

### C. Hierarchical Database Management System (HDBMS)

- **Overview:** HDBMS arranges data in a tree-like structure, where a single parent record can have multiple child records.
- **Examples:** IBM's Information Management System (IMS) and Windows Registry.
- **Characteristics:** Parent-child relationships, top-down organization, and tailored for hierarchical data.

### D. Network Database Management System (NDBMS)

- **Overview:** NDBMS organizes data using a flexible, network-like structure, enabling multiple relationships between records.
- **Examples:** Integrated Data Store (IDS) and Raima Database Manager (RDM).
- **Characteristics:** Multiple parent-child relationships, navigational query model, and intricate data relationships.

### E. NoSQL Database Management System

- **Overview:** NoSQL DBMS is engineered to handle unstructured data, scale horizontally, and ensure high availability.
- **Subcategories:** Document-based, column-based, key-value, and graph-based DBMS.
- **Characteristics:** Depend on the specific NoSQL type.

## Factors to Consider when Selecting a DBMS

- **Data Model:** Comprehend the data structure and relationships required by the application.
- **Scalability:** Examine the capacity to scale horizontally or vertically based on application expansion.
- **Performance:** Gauge the performance requirements, including read and write operations, latency, and throughput.
- **Consistency:** Ascertain the level of data consistency needed, such as immediate consistency or eventual consistency.
- **Availability:** Contemplate the high availability requirements and tolerance for system downtime.
- **Security:** Investigate the security features, including access control, encryption, and auditing capabilities.
- **Licensing and Cost:** Weigh the licensing models and expenses associated with the DBMS.
