20. **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**: A system for managing relational databases using SQL.
21. **Constraint**: A rule for table columns to keep data accurate and consistent.
22. **UNIQUE**: A constraint that makes sure all values in a column are different.
23. **NOT NULL**: A constraint that requires a column to have a value.
24. **Check**: A constraint that forces all column values to meet a certain condition.
25. **Index**: A database object that improves the speed of data retrieval within a table.
26. **View**: A virtual table created from the results of an SQL query.

29. **COMMIT**: An SQL command for saving changes made by a transaction.
30. **ROLLBACK**: An SQL command for undoing changes made by a transaction.
31. **TRIGGER**: A stored procedure that runs automatically when an event (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) occurs in a table.
32. **Stored procedure**: A saved set of SQL statements in a database.
33. **Function**: A set of SQL statements with a name, input parameters, actions, and a result.
34. **Normalization**: A method for organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
35. **Denormalization**: A process of adding redundant data to a database to speed up query performance.
36. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: A part of SQL for creating and modifying database objects like tables and indexes.
37. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: A part of SQL for working with data in a database, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

39. **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**: A part of SQL for handling transactions, including COMMIT and ROLLBACK.
40. **NULL**: A special marker in SQL that indicates a data value is missing or unknown in the database.
41. **NoSQL**: A class of non-relational databases designed for handling various types of data, often providing better scalability and flexibility than traditional relational databases.
42. **CAP Theorem**: A principle stating that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
43. **Sharding**: The process of splitting a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces, often improving performance and scalability.
44. **Partitioning**: The practice of dividing a table into smaller, more manageable pieces based on a specific column or set of columns.
45. **Replication**: The process of copying and maintaining the same data on multiple database nodes to increase availability and fault tolerance.
46. **BASE (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventual Consistency)**: A set of attributes that describe the behavior of some distributed systems, providing a more relaxed approach to consistency compared to ACID properties.
47. **Graph Database**: A type of NoSQL database that stores data as nodes and edges in a graph, optimized for querying and traversing relationships between data points.
48. **Amazon RDS**: A managed relational database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), offering support for multiple database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
49. **Amazon DynamoDB**: A managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS, designed for high availability, scalability, and low latency.
50. **Amazon Aurora**: A managed relational database service provided by AWS, offering compatibility with MySQL and PostgreSQL and improved performance, availability, and scalability.
51. **Caching**: Temporary storage of query results or intermediate data to speed up subsequent query executions.
52. **Horizontal Scaling**: The practice of adding more nodes to a system to handle increased workload, often used in distributed systems to improve performance and availability.
53. **Vertical Scaling**: The practice of adding more resources, such as CPU or memory, to a single node to handle increased workload.
54. **In-Memory Database**: A type of database that stores data in the main memory instead of on disk, providing faster data access and processing times.
55. **SQL Injection**: A security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to insert malicious SQL code into a query, potentially compromising the database or exposing sensitive data.
56. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: A process used to collect, clean, and move data from one or more sources to a data warehouse or another data store.
57. **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**: A class of systems designed for managing transactional workloads, such as inserting, updating, and deleting records.
58. **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**: A class of systems designed for managing analytical workloads, such as complex queries and aggregations.
59. **Data Warehousing**: A large-scale data storage solution optimized for storing, managing, and analyzing large amounts of historical data from various sources.
60. **Big Data**: A term referring to the massive volume, variety, and velocity of data generated by modern applications and devices, often requiring specialized tools and techniques for processing and analysis.
