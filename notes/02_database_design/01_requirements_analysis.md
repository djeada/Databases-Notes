## Database Requirements Analysis

Embarking on the creation of a database is much like planning a new city: you need to understand the needs of its future inhabitants to design it effectively. Database requirements analysis is the process of gathering and defining what the database must accomplish to support an organization's objectives. This step is crucial because it sets the foundation for how data will be stored, accessed, and managed.

Imagine you're building an app for a bookstore. Before diving into coding, you'd need to know what books you'll sell, how customers will find them, and how transactions will be processed. Similarly, analyzing database requirements involves understanding the data's nature, how it interrelates, and how users will interact with it.

After reading the material, you should be able to answer the following questions:

1. What is database requirements analysis, and why is it essential in the database design process?
2. What factors should be considered during requirements analysis, such as data modeling, scalability, performance, data integrity, security, and integration?
3. How do you identify and address the needs of different stakeholders when designing a database system, for example, in the context of a university database?
4. How can data entities and their relationships be mapped out effectively using tools like Entity-Relationship diagrams?
5. What methods and strategies are used to ensure data integrity, optimize performance, implement security measures, and plan for scalability and integration in a database system?

### Considerations in Requirements Analysis

Several important factors come into play when analyzing database requirements to ensure the final system is robust and meets all user needs.
