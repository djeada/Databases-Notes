## Database Requirements Analysis

Database requirements analysis is a pivotal step in the database design process, playing a critical role in ensuring that the designed database aligns with user needs and business objectives.

## Key Considerations During Database Requirements Analysis

- **Data Model Selection**: Determine the most suitable data model (e.g., relational, NoSQL, hierarchical) based on data structure, relationships, and access patterns.
 
- **Scalability Considerations**: Anticipate future growth and assess the system's ability to scale both horizontally and vertically.

- **Performance Requirements**: Define and document performance benchmarks and goals, taking into account speed, latency, and throughput.
 
- **Data Integrity and Consistency**: Ensure data integrity and consistency by establishing rules, constraints, and validation mechanisms.

- **Security and Compliance Measures**: Identify security requirements, compliance standards, and implement necessary measures such as encryption, user authentication, and access control.

- **Integration and Interoperability**: Evaluate the need for integration with other systems, data migration strategies, and ensure seamless data interchange between systems.

## Example: University Database System

The design of a University Database System involves a comprehensive analysis of requirements to ensure that it efficiently meets the needs of stakeholders such as the university administration, faculty members, students, and the IT department.

### I. Stakeholder Identification

- **University Administration**: Needs data to aid in academic planning, resource allocation, and decision-making.
- **Faculty Members**: Require access to student data, course schedules, and grading systems.
- **Students**: Interested in course enrollment, schedules, and grading.
- **IT Department**: Responsible for maintaining, updating, and ensuring the security of the database system.

### II. Business Domain Understanding

- **Processes**: Include course registration, student enrollment, faculty assignment, and grade management.
- **Data Entities**: Essential entities include Students, Courses, Professors, and Course Enrollments, among others.

### III. Scope Definition

- **Objective**: The database aims to streamline academic processes by efficiently managing data about students, courses, and enrollments.
- **Constraints**: The system should adhere to a limited budget, be implemented within a 6-month timeline, and exclusively utilize open-source technologies.

### Requirements Collection and Documentation

#### Functional Requirements

- Maintain comprehensive data including student details (name, ID, contact, enrolled program).
- Store course data (ID, name, description, professor, schedule), and manage enrollments and grading.
- Facilitate efficient retrieval of course offerings per semester and student enrollment lists per course.
- Enable updates to student contact details and course information.

#### Non-functional Requirements

- Ensure low latency with query response times under 2 seconds.
- Design the system to handle up to 10,000 students and 1,000 courses without performance degradation.
- Implement robust security protocols to ensure data access only by authorized users.
- he system should support easy updates, maintenance, and future expansions.

### Requirements Prioritization

1. Core data management functions for students, courses, and enrollments.
2. Features for updating student and course details and recording grades.
3. Performance optimization, scalability, robust security, and maintainability.

### Requirements Validation and Verification

1. Engage stakeholders in reviewing the requirements to ensure alignment with needs and expectations.
2. Verify that requirements can be implemented within the defined scope, budget, and timeline.

| CS101           | Programming I | Intro to programming  | 1                 | MWF 10:00-11:00   |
| MA101           | Calculus I    | Intro to calculus     | 2                 | TTh 14:00-15:30   |
| PH101           | Physics I     | Intro to physics      | 3                 | MWF 13:00-14:00   |

#### Professors

| professor_id (PK) | name              | department       |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1                 | Dr. Alan Turing   | Computer Science |
| 2                 | Dr. Isaac Newton  | Mathematics      |
| 3                 | Dr. Albert Einstein | Physics        |

#### Enrollments

| enrollment_id (PK) | student_id (FK) | course_id (FK) | semester  | grade |
|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| 1                  | 1               | CS101          | Fall 2022 | A     |
