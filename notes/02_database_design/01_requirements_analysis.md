## Database Requirements Analysis

Database requirements analysis is a pivotal step in the database design process, playing a critical role in ensuring that the designed database aligns with user needs and business objectives.

## Steps in Database Requirements Analysis Process

### Stakeholder Identification
- **Objective**: Identify all parties involved in the database project, including end users, developers, managers, and external systems.
- **Activities**:
  - Conduct interviews and workshops to engage stakeholders.
  - Understand and document their expectations and roles in the project.

### Understanding the Business Domain
- **Objective**: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the organization's operations, goals, and constraints.
- **Activities**:
  - Analyze existing documentation, processes, and systems.
  - Determine key data entities, relationships, and attributes that need representation.

### Defining the Scope
- **Objective**: Define the boundaries, functionalities, and limitations of the database system.
- **Activities**:
  - Document constraints such as budget, deadlines, and technological prerequisites.
  - Clearly outline what is in and out of scope for the project.

### Requirement Collection and Documentation
- **Objective**: Gather and document all necessary requirements for the database system.
- **Activities**:
  - Use techniques such as surveys, questionnaires, and user stories to collect functional and non-functional requirements.
  - Ensure documentation is clear, concise, and accessible for stakeholders.

### Requirement Prioritization
- **Objective**: Rank requirements based on their significance to stakeholders and the project's success.
- **Activities**:
  - Employ techniques like the MoSCoW method (Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves) to prioritize requirements.
  - Resolve conflicting requirements through negotiation and consensus.

### Requirement Validation and Verification
- **Objective**: Ensure that the gathered requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs and are feasible.
- **Activities**:
  - Conduct reviews, walkthroughs, and prototype evaluations to validate requirements.
  - Ensure requirements are complete, consistent, and testable.

## Key Considerations During Database Requirements Analysis

- **Data Model Selection**: Determine the most suitable data model (e.g., relational, NoSQL, hierarchical) based on data structure, relationships, and access patterns.
 
- **Scalability Considerations**: Anticipate future growth and assess the system's ability to scale both horizontally and vertically.

- **Performance Requirements**: Define and document performance benchmarks and goals, taking into account speed, latency, and throughput.
 
- **Data Integrity and Consistency**: Ensure data integrity and consistency by establishing rules, constraints, and validation mechanisms.

- **Security and Compliance Measures**: Identify security requirements, compliance standards, and implement necessary measures such as encryption, user authentication, and access control.

- **Integration and Interoperability**: Evaluate the need for integration with other systems, data migration strategies, and ensure seamless data interchange between systems.

## Example: University Database System

The design of a University Database System involves a comprehensive analysis of requirements to ensure that it efficiently meets the needs of stakeholders such as the university administration, faculty members, students, and the IT department.

### Stakeholder Identification

- **University Administration**: Needs data to aid in academic planning, resource allocation, and decision-making.
- **Faculty Members**: Require access to student data, course schedules, and grading systems.
- **Students**: Interested in course enrollment, schedules, and grading.
- **IT Department**: Responsible for maintaining, updating, and ensuring the security of the database system.

### Business Domain Understanding

- **Processes**: Include course registration, student enrollment, faculty assignment, and grade management.
- **Data Entities**: Essential entities include Students, Courses, Professors, and Course Enrollments, among others.

### Scope Definition

- **Objective**: The database aims to streamline academic processes by efficiently managing data about students, courses, and enrollments.
- **Constraints**: The system should adhere to a limited budget, be implemented within a 6-month timeline, and exclusively utilize open-source technologies.

### Requirements Collection and Documentation

#### Functional Requirements

- **Student Records**: Maintain comprehensive data including student details (name, ID, contact, enrolled program).
- **Course Management**: Store course data (ID, name, description, professor, schedule), and manage enrollments and grading.
- **Data Retrieval**: Facilitate efficient retrieval of course offerings per semester and student enrollment lists per course.
- **Data Updates**: Enable updates to student contact details and course information.

#### Non-functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Ensure low latency with query response times under 2 seconds.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to handle up to 10,000 students and 1,000 courses without performance degradation.
- **Security**: Implement robust security protocols to ensure data access only by authorized users.
- **Maintainability**: The system should support easy updates, maintenance, and future expansions.

### Requirements Prioritization

- **Essential**: Core data management functions for students, courses, and enrollments.
- **Important**: Features for updating student and course details and recording grades.
- **Desirable**: Performance optimization, scalability, robust security, and maintainability.

### Requirements Validation and Verification

- **Validation**: Engage stakeholders in reviewing the requirements to ensure alignment with needs and expectations.
- **Feasibility Check**: Verify that requirements can be implemented within the defined scope, budget, and timeline.
