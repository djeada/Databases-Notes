## Consistency

Consistency is one of the ACID properties of database transactions, ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction. This note delves into the concept of consistency, its significance in preserving data integrity, and examples that illustrate its importance.

## Importance of Consistency

### Data Integrity
Consistency ensures that the data in the database adheres to predefined rules and constraints, preventing data anomalies and maintaining data accuracy.

### Error Prevention
By enforcing consistency, the database system can detect and prevent potential errors or conflicts that could lead to an inconsistent state.

## Examples

### Unique Constraints Example

1. Consider an e-commerce application where each user must have a unique email address. The database enforces a unique constraint on the email column in the users table to maintain consistency.

2. When a new user tries to register with an email address that already exists in the database, the consistency rule prevents the insertion of duplicate data and maintains the unique constraint.

### Foreign Key Constraints Example

1. In an online ticket booking system, a transaction may involve creating a new booking record for a customer and updating the available seats for the event. The booking record includes a foreign key reference to the event.

2. Consistency requires that the foreign key constraint is maintained, ensuring that the booking record points to a valid event in the events table. If an attempt is made to create a booking for a non-existent event, the foreign key constraint prevents the transaction from being executed, maintaining data consistency.

### Domain Constraints Example

1. In a payroll system, the salary column in the employees table has a domain constraint that requires the salary to be a positive number.

2. If an update transaction tries to set the salary of an employee to a negative value, the domain constraint prevents the update from being executed, maintaining consistency and data integrity.

## Maintaining Consistency

### Transaction Isolation
Transaction isolation levels control the visibility of data changes made by concurrent transactions, helping to maintain consistency by preventing conflicts between transactions.

### Concurrency Control
Mechanisms such as locking and optimistic concurrency control help manage concurrent access to the database and maintain consistency by preventing conflicting updates and ensuring transaction isolation.
