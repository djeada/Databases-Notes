## Isolation

Isolation is one of the ACID properties of database transactions, ensuring that the intermediate results of a transaction are not visible to other concurrently executing transactions.

## Importance of Isolation

### Concurrency Control
Isolation is crucial for managing concurrent access to the database, preventing conflicts and data inconsistencies that may arise when multiple transactions attempt to read or modify the same data simultaneously.
    
### Data Integrity
By ensuring isolation, the database can maintain data integrity and consistency even in highly concurrent environments.

## Examples

### Dirty Read Example

1. Consider a banking application where a transaction T1 transfers $100 from account A to account B. The transaction involves two steps: (a) withdraw $100 from account A, and (b) deposit $100 into account B.

2. Meanwhile, a second transaction T2 checks the balance of account A. Without proper isolation, T2 might read the balance of account A after step (a) but before step (b) is completed, resulting in an incorrect balance reading.

3. By enforcing isolation, T2 can only see the final results of T1, ensuring that the balance read by T2 is accurate.

### Non-Repeatable Read Example

1. In an inventory management system, a transaction T1 reads the stock level of a product, calculates the new stock level based on a sales order, and updates the stock level in the database.

2. Simultaneously, another transaction T2 modifies the stock level of the same product. Without proper isolation, T1 might read the stock level again after T2's update, resulting in an incorrect final stock level calculation.

3. By maintaining isolation, T1's subsequent reads of the stock level will return the same value as the initial read, ensuring a correct final stock level calculation.

## Transaction Isolation Levels

Different isolation levels can be set for transactions to balance the trade-off between isolation and performance. Higher isolation levels provide greater consistency but may lead to reduced concurrency and increased contention.

1. Read Uncommitted
2. Read Committed
3. Repeatable Read
4. Serializable

## Concurrency Control Mechanisms

### Locking
Locking is a technique used to enforce isolation by preventing multiple transactions from accessing the same data simultaneously. Locks can be applied at various levels, such as row-level or table-level.
    
### Optimistic Concurrency Control
Optimistic concurrency control allows transactions to proceed without acquiring locks but validates the data at the time of commit to ensure no conflicts occurred during the transaction.
