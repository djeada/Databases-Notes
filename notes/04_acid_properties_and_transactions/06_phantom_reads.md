## Phantom reads

Phantom reads are a type of anomaly that can occur in database transactions when new rows are added or removed by a concurrent transaction. This leads to unexpected results in subsequent read operations within the same transaction.

## Phantom Read Example

### Inventory Management Scenario

1. Imagine a transaction T1 that reads the number of products with stock levels below a certain threshold to reorder them.

2. At the same time, another transaction T2 adds new products to the inventory, some of which also have stock levels below the threshold.

3. If T1 reads the product count again after T2 has committed, it may see a different count due to the newly added products, even though T1 has not explicitly modified any data. This unexpected change in the result set is known as a phantom read.
    
## Implications of Phantom Reads

### Data Integrity
Phantom reads can lead to inconsistencies and incorrect results because the transaction operates on a different set of data than initially expected.
    
### Concurrency Issues
Phantom reads result from concurrency issues, where multiple transactions access and modify the same data simultaneously, leading to unexpected outcomes.
    
## Preventing Phantom Reads

### Transaction Isolation Levels
To avoid phantom reads, you can use higher transaction isolation levels like Repeatable Read or Serializable. These isolation levels ensure that the same data is consistently returned for subsequent read operations within the same transaction.
    
### Locking Mechanisms
Locking mechanisms, such as row-level locking or range locking, can also help prevent phantom reads. By acquiring locks on relevant data, the transaction can ensure that no new rows can be added or removed by other concurrent transactions until the current transaction is completed.
    
### Snapshot Isolation
Snapshot isolation is another method to prevent phantom reads by providing each transaction with a consistent snapshot of the database at the start of the transaction. This ensures that any changes made by concurrent transactions are not visible to the current transaction, preventing phantom reads and other anomalies.
