## Introduction
- Partitioning is a database optimization technique
- Improves performance and manageability of large tables
- Covers: concept of partitioning, types of partitioning, and their use cases

## Partitioning Basics

### Purpose
1. Divide large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces
2. Improve query performance by accessing only relevant partitions
3. Simplify data management tasks (e.g., backup, archiving, etc.)

### Types
1. Range partitioning
2. List partitioning
3. Hash partitioning
4. Key partitioning
5. Composite partitioning

## Range Partitioning

### Description
Divides table based on a range of values in a specified column

### Use Cases
- Time-based data (e.g., sales data partitioned by date or month)
- Continuous numerical data (e.g., income range or age groups)

## List Partitioning

### Description
Divides table based on a list of predefined values in a specified column

### Use Cases
- Categorical data (e.g., partition by country or department)
- Non-contiguous or discrete values

## Hash Partitioning

### Description
Divides table based on a hash function applied to a specified column

### Use Cases
- Evenly distribute data across partitions
- No clear range or list partitioning criteria
- Balance I/O load across multiple disks

## Key Partitioning

### Description
Similar to hash partitioning, but uses primary key columns for the hash function

### Use Cases
- Evenly distribute data across partitions using primary keys
- When primary key columns are the most accessed columns in queries

## Composite Partitioning

### Description
Combines two or more partitioning types (e.g., range-hash, range-list, etc.)

### Use Cases
- Complex partitioning requirements
- Further subdivide partitions for more granular data management or performance optimization

## Best Practices
- Choose partitioning type based on query patterns and data characteristics
- Regularly monitor and adjust partitioning schemes to maintain performance
- Consider partition pruning to optimize query performance
- Periodically reorganize or rebuild partitions for maintenance
