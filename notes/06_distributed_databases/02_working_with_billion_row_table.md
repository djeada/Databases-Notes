## Working with Billion Row Tables

Working with large tables containing billions of rows can pose challenges in terms of performance, scalability, and maintenance. This guide covers general strategies and techniques for handling billion-row tables in both single-node and distributed database environments.

### General Techniques

#### Partitioning

Divide large tables into smaller partitions based on a specified partition key, which can improve query performance and manageability.

**Example:**

```sql
-- PostgreSQL partitioning example using RANGE partitioning on the `date` column
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    total DECIMAL(10, 2)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (date);

CREATE TABLE orders_2021 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES FROM ('2021-01-01') TO ('2022-01-01');
CREATE TABLE orders_2022 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES FROM ('2022-01-01') TO ('2023-01-01');
```

### Indexing

Create and maintain indexes on frequently accessed columns to speed up query execution.

Example:

```sql
-- Creating an index on the `customer_id` column in the `orders` table
CREATE INDEX orders_customer_id_idx ON orders (customer_id);
```

### Materialized Views

Store precomputed query results to reduce the cost of complex or frequently executed queries.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Creating a materialized view for the total revenue by customer
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW total_revenue_by_customer AS
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total) as total_revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### Query Optimization

Optimize queries by using techniques like query rewriting, join optimization, and parallelism to improve performance.

## Distributed Database Techniques

### Sharding

Partition the data across multiple nodes based on a specified shard key. This distributes the load and improves performance in distributed environments.

**Example:**

```python
# Using the Django ORM with a sharded database (using the django-sharding-library)
from django_sharding_library.decorators import shard_storage_config
from django_sharding_library.fields import ShardedIDField
from django.db import models

class Order(models.Model):
    id = ShardedIDField(primary_key=True, source_table_name='orders')
    customer_id = models.IntegerField()
    date = models.DateField()
    total = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)

    @shard_storage_config
    def get_shard(self):
        return 'shard_{}'.format(self.customer_id % 4)
```

### Distributed Caching

Implement caching across multiple nodes in a distributed database system to scale caching capacity and improve performance.

**Example:**

```python
# Using Python's Redis library for distributed caching
import redis

cache = redis.Redis(host='redis_host', port=6379)

def get_popular_products():
    cache_key = 'popular_products'
    popular_products = cache.get(cache_key)

    if popular_products is None:
        popular_products = Product.objects.filter(is_popular=True)
        cache.set(cache_key, popular_products, 60 * 60)  # Cache the results for 1 hour

    return popular_products
```

### Data Replication

Replicate data across multiple nodes to improve fault tolerance, load balancing, and read performance.

## Best Practices

- Choose appropriate techniques based on the system requirements and workload
- Monitor and analyze query performance to identify areas for improvement
- Continuously review and adjust strategies to maintain optimal performance
