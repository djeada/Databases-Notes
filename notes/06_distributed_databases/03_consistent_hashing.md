## Introduction
- Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing technique
- Provides even data distribution and minimal data movement during node addition/removal
- Covers: concept of consistent hashing, use cases, and benefits

## Consistent Hashing Basics

### Purpose
1. Distribute data across nodes in a distributed system
2. Minimize data movement when nodes are added or removed
3. Ensure balanced load on nodes

### Key Concepts
1. Hash Ring: a circular hash space where nodes and data are mapped
2. Hash Function: maps data and nodes to points on the hash ring
3. Virtual Nodes: multiple points on the hash ring representing a single physical node

## How Consistent Hashing Works

### Mapping Nodes and Data
- Apply the hash function to each node to determine its position on the hash ring
- Apply the hash function to each data item to determine its position on the hash ring

### Data Assignment
- Assign each data item to the first node encountered in the clockwise direction on the hash ring

### Node Addition or Removal
- When a node is added, it takes over some data items from its neighbors
- When a node is removed, its data items are redistributed to the remaining neighbors

## Use Cases
- Distributed caching systems (e.g., Memcached, Redis)
- Distributed databases (e.g., Apache Cassandra, DynamoDB)
- Load balancing across servers
- Distributed file systems

## Benefits of Consistent Hashing

### Even Data Distribution
Distributes data uniformly across nodes, avoiding hotspots

### Minimal Data Movement
Minimizes data movement when nodes are added or removed, reducing overhead

### Load Balancing
Ensures balanced load on nodes, improving overall system performance

## Best Practices
- Use a suitable hash function that provides good distribution and minimal collisions
- Implement virtual nodes to better handle node heterogeneity and improve data distribution
- Monitor and adjust the consistent hashing scheme as the system evolves to maintain performance
