## Partitioning vs sharding 
- Partitioning and sharding are data partitioning techniques
- Improve performance and manageability of large datasets

## Partitioning
### Definition
A technique used to divide a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces called partitions

### Purpose
- Improve query performance by accessing only relevant partitions
- Simplify data management tasks (e.g., backup, archiving, etc.)

### Types
1. Range partitioning
2. List partitioning
3. Hash partitioning
4. Key partitioning
5. Composite partitioning

## Sharding

### Definition
A technique used to split large datasets into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards, distributed across multiple nodes or clusters

### Purpose
- Improve performance and scalability of large datasets in distributed systems
- Distribute data across multiple nodes or clusters
- Reduce query latency by parallelizing operations across shards

### Strategies
1. Range-based sharding
2. Hash-based sharding
3. List-based sharding

## Differences Between Partitioning and Sharding

### Scope
Partitioning typically occurs within a single database or a single node, whereas sharding distributes data across multiple nodes or clusters in a distributed system

### Granularity
Partitioning focuses on dividing a single table, while sharding splits an entire dataset (which may include multiple tables)

### Data Management
Partitioning simplifies data management tasks within a single database, while sharding addresses challenges in distributed systems such as scalability and fault isolation

## Use Cases

### Partitioning
- Time-based data (e.g., sales data partitioned by date)
- Categorical data (e.g., partition by country or department)

### Sharding
- Distributed databases (e.g., MongoDB, Apache Cassandra)
- Distributed caching systems (e.g., Memcached, Redis)
- Large-scale, high-traffic applications with horizontal scaling requirements

## Best Practices
- Choose partitioning or sharding based on system requirements, data characteristics, and query patterns
- Combine partitioning and sharding to optimize performance and manageability in large-scale distributed systems
- Monitor and adjust partitioning or sharding schemes as the system evolves to maintain performance
