## Deadlocks
- Deadlocks are a critical issue in database systems
- Occur when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release locks on resources

## Deadlock Concepts
- A situation where two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for each other to release locks on resources
- Circular waiting: each transaction is waiting for another transaction in a circular chain
- No progress: none of the transactions in the deadlock can proceed or complete

```
  T1      T2
  |       |
  v       v
Lock A  Lock B
  ^       ^
  |       |
  |-------|----> Requests Lock B
  |       |
  |<------|---- Requests Lock A
  |       |
```

In the diagram above:

- T1 holds Lock A and requests Lock B, which is held by T2.
- T2 holds Lock B and requests Lock A, which is held by T1.

Since neither transaction can proceed until the other releases its lock, a deadlock occurs.

## Causes of Deadlocks

- Transactions lock resources in different orders, causing circular dependencies
- Transactions with multiple levels of nesting can create complex locking scenarios
- Holding locks for extended periods of time increases the chances of deadlocks

## Deadlock Detection

### Wait-for graph
- A directed graph representing transactions and their locked resources
- Deadlocks can be detected by finding cycles in the wait-for graph

### Database management system (DBMS) detection
- Some DBMSs automatically detect deadlocks and resolve them

## Deadlock Prevention

- Enforce a consistent order for acquiring locks on resources
- Implement timeouts for lock requests to prevent indefinite waiting
- Use lock escalation or partitioning to reduce the chance of deadlocks

## Deadlock Resolution

- Choose a transaction involved in the deadlock to terminate or roll back
- Use priority-based schemes to determine which transaction should wait or be terminated
- Identify deadlocks through monitoring tools and manually resolve them

## Best Practices
- Understand deadlock concepts and their impact on database performance and reliability
- Implement deadlock prevention strategies to minimize the occurrence of deadlocks
- Monitor and detect deadlocks using database tools and techniques
- Be prepared to resolve deadlocks when they occur to maintain database performance and integrity
