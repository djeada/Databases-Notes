## Shared and exclusive locks
- Shared and exclusive locks are locking mechanisms in databases
- Used to manage concurrent access to resources and maintain data integrity

## Shared Locks
- A lock that allows multiple transactions to read a resource concurrently

### Purpose
- Prevent modifications to a resource while it's being read by other transactions
- Ensure consistent reads for multiple transactions

### Characteristics
- Multiple shared locks can be held on a resource simultaneously
- Conflicts with exclusive locks

## Exclusive Locks
- A lock that allows only one transaction to access a resource for modification

### Purpose
- Ensure data integrity by preventing concurrent modifications to a resource
- Prevent other transactions from reading or modifying a resource during an update

### Characteristics
- Only one exclusive lock can be held on a resource at a time
- Conflicts with both shared locks and other exclusive locks

## Differences Between Shared and Exclusive Locks

### Access Mode
- Shared locks allow concurrent reads, while exclusive locks allow exclusive access for modifications

### Conflicts
- Shared locks do not conflict with other shared locks, but conflict with exclusive locks
- Exclusive locks conflict with both shared locks and other exclusive locks

### Impact on Concurrency
- Shared locks promote higher concurrency for read operations
- Exclusive locks limit concurrency for modification operations to ensure data integrity

## Use Cases

### Shared Locks
- Read-heavy workloads with frequent concurrent reads
- Situations where data consistency is a priority during concurrent reads

### Exclusive Locks
- Update or delete operations where data integrity must be maintained
- Situations requiring exclusive access to a resource for modification

## Best Practices
- Understand the differences between shared and exclusive locks and their impact on concurrency and data integrity
- Choose the appropriate lock type based on the specific database operation and system requirements
- Monitor and adjust database locking mechanisms to optimize performance and minimize contention
