## Shared and Exclusive Locks in Database Systems

Shared and exclusive locks are mechanisms used in database systems to manage concurrent access to resources, maintaining data consistency and integrity.

```
Shared Locks
------------
Transaction A  |--> Read Resource X -- Shared Lock (S) -->|
Transaction B  |--> Read Resource X -- Shared Lock (S) -->|

Exclusive Lock
--------------
Transaction C  |--> Modify Resource Y -- Exclusive Lock (X) --> No other transactions can modify Y
Transaction D  | Blocked trying to get Exclusive Lock (X) on Resource Y
```

- Transaction A and Transaction B both are able to read Resource X simultaneously as they hold a shared lock (S). The shared locks allow multiple transactions to read the same resource concurrently.
- Transaction C has an exclusive lock (X) on Resource Y as it is modifying it. During this period, no other transaction can read or modify Resource Y. As depicted, Transaction D is blocked while trying to get an exclusive lock (X) on Resource Y, demonstrating how exclusive locks limit access to a resource to a single transaction.


### Shared Locks

Shared locks (also known as 'read locks') allow multiple transactions to read (but not modify) the same resource concurrently.

**Characteristics of Shared Locks:**
- Allow concurrent reads: Multiple transactions can hold shared locks on the same resource simultaneously.
- Prevent modifications: Shared locks restrict any modification on the locked resource.
- Conflict with exclusive locks: A shared lock cannot be placed on a resource if an exclusive lock on the resource exists.

**Use Cases for Shared Locks:**
- Applicable in read-heavy workloads where data consistency during concurrent reads is a priority.

### Exclusive Locks

Exclusive locks (also known as 'write locks') ensure a single transaction has exclusive access to a resource for modification, preventing all other transactions from accessing the resource during the lock period.

**Characteristics of Exclusive Locks:**
- Allow a single transaction access for modification: Only one exclusive lock can be held on a resource at any given time.
- Conflict with both shared and exclusive locks: An exclusive lock cannot be placed on a resource if any shared lock or another exclusive lock exists on the resource.

**Use Cases for Exclusive Locks:**
- Crucial for update or delete operations to ensure data integrity.
- Required when exclusive access to a resource for modification is necessary.

### Comparing Shared and Exclusive Locks

**Access Mode:**
- Shared locks support concurrency for read operations.
- Exclusive locks allow only one transaction for modification, thus limiting concurrency.

**Conflicts:**
- Shared locks can coexist with other shared locks but not with exclusive locks.
- Exclusive locks conflict with both shared and other exclusive locks.

**Concurrency Impact:**
- Shared locks allow higher concurrency levels for read operations.
- Exclusive locks restrict concurrency for modification operations to ensure data integrity.

## Best Practices
- Understand the differences between shared and exclusive locks and their impact on concurrency and data integrity
- Choose the appropriate lock type based on the specific database operation and system requirements
- Monitor and adjust database locking mechanisms to optimize performance and minimize contention
