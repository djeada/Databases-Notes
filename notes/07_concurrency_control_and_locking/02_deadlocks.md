## Deadlocks
- Deadlocks are a critical issue in database systems
- Occur when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release locks on resources

## Deadlock Concepts
- A situation where two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for each other to release locks on resources

### Characteristics
- Circular waiting: each transaction is waiting for another transaction in a circular chain
- No progress: none of the transactions in the deadlock can proceed or complete

## Causes of Deadlocks

### Locking dependencies
Transactions lock resources in different orders, causing circular dependencies

###  Nested transactions
Transactions with multiple levels of nesting can create complex locking scenarios

### Long-held locks
Holding locks for extended periods of time increases the chances of deadlocks

## Deadlock Detection

### Wait-for graph
- A directed graph representing transactions and their locked resources
- Deadlocks can be detected by finding cycles in the wait-for graph

### Database management system (DBMS) detection
- Some DBMSs automatically detect deadlocks and resolve them

## Deadlock Prevention

### Lock ordering
Enforce a consistent order for acquiring locks on resources

### Timeout strategies
Implement timeouts for lock requests to prevent indefinite waiting

### Granularity control
Use lock escalation or partitioning to reduce the chance of deadlocks

## Deadlock Resolution
### Victim selection
Choose a transaction involved in the deadlock to terminate or roll back

### Wait-die and wound-wait schemes
Use priority-based schemes to determine which transaction should wait or be terminated

### Manual intervention
Identify deadlocks through monitoring tools and manually resolve them

## Best Practices
- Understand deadlock concepts and their impact on database performance and reliability
- Implement deadlock prevention strategies to minimize the occurrence of deadlocks
- Monitor and detect deadlocks using database tools and techniques
- Be prepared to resolve deadlocks when they occur to maintain database performance and integrity
