## Two-phase locking
- Two-phase locking (2PL) is a concurrency control technique in databases
- Ensures serializability and consistency in transactions

## Two-Phase Locking Concepts
A locking protocol that governs how transactions acquire and release locks on resources

### Purpose
- Ensure serializability and consistency in concurrent transactions
- Prevent conflicts and maintain isolation between transactions

## Phases of Two-Phase Locking

### Growing Phase
- Transactions acquire locks on resources as needed
- No locks can be released during this phase

### Shrinking Phase
- Transactions release their locks on resources
- No new locks can be acquired during this phase

## Types of Two-Phase Locking

### Basic 2PL
- Transactions follow the growing and shrinking phases strictly
- Can lead to deadlocks and reduced concurrency

### Conservative 2PL
- Transactions acquire all necessary locks before starting execution
- Reduces the likelihood of deadlocks but may have lower concurrency

### Strict 2PL
- Transactions hold exclusive locks on resources until the transaction is fully committed or rolled back
- Prevents cascading aborts and improves recoverability

## Advantages of Two-Phase Locking
- Ensures serializability and consistency in transactions
- Provides a simple and structured approach to manage concurrency
- Allows for different variations to balance performance and recoverability

## Disadvantages of Two-Phase Locking
- Can lead to deadlocks and reduced concurrency in some cases
- May result in lock contention and decreased throughput
- Requires careful management and tuning of locking mechanisms

## Best Practices
- Understand the concepts and types of two-phase locking and their impact on database performance and consistency
- Choose the appropriate type of 2PL based on system requirements and priorities
- Monitor and adjust locking mechanisms to optimize performance and maintain consistency in concurrent transactions
