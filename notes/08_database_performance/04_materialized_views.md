# Materialized Views

Materialized views are a powerful database feature that stores the results of a query physically on disk, providing fast access to precomputed data. Unlike standard (virtual) views, which execute their underlying query each time they are accessed, materialized views cache the query results and can be refreshed on-demand or at specified intervals. This feature significantly improves performance for complex queries, especially in environments where data does not change frequently or real-time data is not critical.

## Concepts and Characteristics

### Stored Query Results

Materialized views physically store the result set of a query in the database. This storage eliminates the need to re-execute the query each time the data is requested.

- **Reduction of Computation**: By storing the results, the database avoids recalculating complex joins, aggregations, and calculations.
- **Data Retrieval**: Accessing data from a materialized view is similar to querying a regular table, providing faster data retrieval.

### Refresh Strategies

Since the data in a materialized view is a snapshot of the data at the time it was created or last refreshed, it can become stale as the underlying tables change.

- **Manual Refresh**: The materialized view is refreshed only when explicitly instructed.
- **Automatic Refresh**: The database system automatically refreshes the materialized view at specified intervals or upon certain events.
- **Incremental Refresh**: Only the changes since the last refresh are applied, improving refresh efficiency.
- **Complete Refresh**: The entire materialized view is recomputed from scratch.

### Performance Improvement

Materialized views enhance performance by:

- **Reducing Query Execution Time**: Complex queries run faster because the heavy computation is done in advance.
- **Load Distribution**: Shifts computational load from query time to refresh time, which can be scheduled during off-peak hours.
- **Supporting Indexes**: Indexes can be created on materialized views, further improving query performance.

### Storage Cost

Storing the result set consumes additional disk space.

- **Storage Planning**: Assess the trade-off between storage cost and performance gain.
- **Compression**: Some databases support data compression to mitigate storage requirements.
- **Archiving**: Old or less frequently used materialized views can be archived or dropped.

### Data Consistency

Materialized views may not reflect real-time data changes.

- **Staleness**: The data is only as fresh as the last refresh.
- **Consistency Levels**: Define acceptable staleness levels based on application requirements.
- **Transactional Consistency**: Ensuring that the data in the materialized view is consistent with the underlying tables at a transaction level.

### Indexing Materialized Views

Indexes can be applied to materialized views to optimize query performance.

- **Creating Indexes**: Similar to indexing tables, indexes can be created on columns in the materialized view.
- **Maintaining Indexes**: Indexes need to be maintained during refresh operations, which may impact refresh performance.

## Use Cases

### Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence

In data warehousing environments, materialized views are invaluable for:

- **Aggregating Large Data Sets**: Precomputing sums, averages, counts, and other aggregations over massive tables.
- **Simplifying Complex Queries**: Storing results of multi-join queries to simplify reporting queries.
- **Improving Dashboard Performance**: Enhancing the responsiveness of BI tools and dashboards that rely on heavy data computations.

**Real-World Example**:

A retail company maintains a data warehouse to analyze sales data across multiple stores and regions. Materialized views can store aggregated sales data per region, reducing the time required for analysts to generate sales reports.

### Pre-aggregation in OLAP Systems

Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems benefit from materialized views by:

- **Speeding Up Multi-dimensional Queries**: Storing pre-aggregated data across different dimensions (e.g., time, geography, product).
- **Enhancing Cube Performance**: Materialized views can act as building blocks for OLAP cubes.

**Example**:

An airline uses an OLAP system to analyze flight data. Materialized views can store aggregated metrics like average delays per route, enabling quick analysis and decision-making.

### Distributed Databases and Replication

In distributed database systems:

- **Data Replication**: Materialized views can replicate data across nodes, improving data locality and access speed.
- **Data Consolidation**: Aggregating data from multiple sources into a single materialized view.

**Example**:

A global enterprise with databases in different regions can use materialized views to consolidate financial data into a central location for corporate reporting.

### Materialized Views in Partitioned Tables

Materialized views can work with partitioned tables to:

- **Improve Query Performance on Partitioned Data**: Precompute results on partitions to speed up queries that span multiple partitions.
- **Facilitate Data Archiving**: Materialized views can be used to summarize archived data.

**Example**:

A telecom company partitions call detail records by month. Materialized views can aggregate data on each partition to provide monthly summaries.

### Caching Complex Calculations

For applications involving complex calculations:

- **Precomputing Expensive Calculations**: Materialized views can store the results of computationally intensive operations.
- **Reducing Application Load**: Offloading calculations to the database reduces application server load.

**Example**:

A scientific research database performs complex statistical analyses on large datasets. Materialized views can store the results of these analyses for faster access by researchers.

## Examples

### Creating a Materialized View in PostgreSQL

**Scenario**:

You have a `sales` table with millions of records, and you frequently need to report total sales per region.

**Creating the Materialized View**:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY region;
```

**Indexing the Materialized View**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_summary_region ON sales_summary (region);
```

**Querying the Materialized View**:

```sql
SELECT region, total_sales
FROM sales_summary
WHERE region = 'North America';
```

**Refreshing the Materialized View**:

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;
```

**Automating the Refresh**:

Set up a cron job or use a scheduling tool to run the refresh command at specified intervals.

### Incremental Refresh in Oracle

**Scenario**:

An Oracle database with a `transactions` table where new transactions are added continuously.

**Creating Materialized View Log**:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ON transactions
WITH PRIMARY KEY, ROWID
INCLUDING NEW VALUES;
```

**Creating the Materialized View with Fast Refresh**:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW transactions_summary
BUILD IMMEDIATE
REFRESH FAST ON COMMIT
AS
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM transactions
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Explanation**:

- **`REFRESH FAST ON COMMIT`**: The materialized view is incrementally refreshed whenever a transaction on the base table is committed.
- **Materialized View Log**: Stores changes to the base table, enabling incremental refresh.

### Using Materialized Views in SQL Server

**Scenario**:

In SQL Server, you want to create an indexed view to optimize query performance.

**Creating the Indexed View**:

```sql
CREATE VIEW dbo.SalesSummary
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales, COUNT_BIG(*) AS row_count
FROM dbo.Sales
GROUP BY region;
GO

CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_SalesSummary_region
ON dbo.SalesSummary (region);
```

**Requirements**:

- **`WITH SCHEMABINDING`**: Binds the view to the schema of the underlying tables.
- **Deterministic Functions**: Only deterministic functions are allowed.
- **Indexed View Limitations**: Must meet specific criteria to be indexed.

**Querying the Indexed View**:

```sql
SELECT region, total_sales
FROM dbo.SalesSummary
WHERE region = 'Europe';
```

**Automatic Updates**:

Changes to the `Sales` table automatically update the indexed view.
