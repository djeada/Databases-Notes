## Indexing strategies
- Indexing strategies are crucial for improving query performance
- Different strategies cater to different use cases and data types

## B-trees Indexing Strategy
- Balanced tree data structure
- Suitable for ordered data and a wide range of queries

### Characteristics
- Logarithmic search, insertion, and deletion times
- Efficient for range queries and sorting

###  Use Cases
- Primary and secondary indexes
- Ordered data and range queries

## Bitmap Indexing Strategy
- Bit array data structure
- Suitable for low-cardinality data

### Characteristics
- Efficient set operations (e.g., intersection, union)
- Compressed storage for compact representation

### Use Cases
- Data warehousing and analytics
- Low-cardinality columns and complex filtering

## Hash Indexing Strategy
- Hash table data structure
- Suitable for exact-match queries

### Characteristics
- Constant-time search, insertion, and deletion operations
- Inefficient for range queries and sorting

### Use Cases
- Lookup tables and primary key indexes
- Exact-match queries on unordered data

## Full-Text Indexing Strategy
- Specialized index for text data
- Suitable for complex text searches

### Characteristics
- Supports complex text queries, such as phrases and proximity searches
- Typically implemented using an inverted index data structure

### Use Cases
- Text data and document storage
- Complex text searches and natural language processing

## Best Practices
- Understand the characteristics and use cases of different indexing strategies
- Choose the appropriate indexing strategy based on the data type and query workload
- Monitor and analyze index performance to identify areas for improvement
- Continuously review and adjust indexing strategies to maintain optimal query performance
