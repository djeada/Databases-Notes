## Materialized views
- Materialized views are precomputed query results for faster access
- Useful for improving the performance of complex or frequently executed queries
- Covers: concepts, use cases, and best practices of materialized views

## Materialized Views Concepts
- A materialized view is a stored, precomputed result of a query

### Purpose
- Reduce query execution time by providing precomputed results
- Offload complex calculations from the main database

### Characteristics
- Stored on disk and updated periodically
- Can be indexed for faster retrieval

## Use Cases for Materialized Views

### Complex Queries
- Aggregate functions, joins, and subqueries that are expensive to compute

### Data Warehousing and Analytics
- Frequent execution of the same or similar queries for reporting or analysis purposes

### Distributed Databases
- Replicate data across multiple nodes for faster access and reduced latency

## Best Practices
- Identify the queries or calculations that can benefit from materialized views
- Determine the appropriate refresh strategy for materialized views based on data freshness requirements
- Consider indexing materialized views for even faster access
- Monitor and analyze the performance of materialized views to identify areas for improvement
- Periodically review and adjust materialized views based on changing requirements and query patterns
