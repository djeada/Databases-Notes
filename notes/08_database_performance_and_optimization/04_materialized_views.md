## Materialized Views

Materialized views are a database feature that allows the storage of precomputed results from a query. Unlike a regular view, which does not store data and executes its underlying query each time it's accessed, a materialized view stores the result of its query at the time it is defined. This offers faster data access at the cost of storage and the need to manage data refreshes.

## Detailed Overview

### Concepts and Characteristics

1. Stored Query Results: Materialized views store the result set of a query, reducing the need to perform potentially costly operations like joins or aggregations each time the data is requested.

2. Refresh Strategies: The data in a materialized view can become outdated when the underlying tables change. Different strategies, such as on-demand or at regular intervals (periodic refreshes), can be used to update the view.

3. Performance Improvement: Materialized views can significantly improve query performance, especially for complex queries or in scenarios where the same query is executed frequently.

4. Storage Cost: The trade-off for the performance gain is increased storage usage, as the result set of the query is stored physically.

### Use Cases

1. Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence: Materialized views are commonly used in data warehousing environments where complex aggregation queries are frequently executed for analytical reporting.

2. Pre-aggregation in OLAP systems: Materialized views can hold pre-aggregated data and hence speed up OLAP queries which involve complex aggregations.

3. Distributed Databases: In distributed systems, materialized views can replicate data across multiple nodes, thus improving data access speed and reducing latency.

## Example: PostgreSQL Materialized View

Consider a PostgreSQL database with a `sales` table storing millions of sales transactions. A common operation might be to report the total sales per region:

```sql
SELECT region, SUM(amount) 
FROM sales 
GROUP BY region;
```

If this operation needs to be performed frequently, it could be expensive to execute each time. A materialized view could store the results for faster access:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT region, SUM(amount) 
FROM sales 
GROUP BY region;
```

This creates a sales_summary materialized view that holds the pre-computed sum of sales per region. When you need the summary data, you can query the materialized view instead of running the aggregate query on the entire sales table:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM sales_summary;
```

Refresh the materialized view to keep the data updated:

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;
```

## Best Practices

- Appropriate Use: Use materialized views for complex and frequently executed queries where the slight delay due to the refresh mechanism is acceptable.
- Refresh Strategy: Choose the refresh strategy that best suits your applicationâ€™s needs. For instance, a near real-time application might require a more frequent refresh compared to a reporting application that can work with slightly stale data.
- Performance Monitoring: Regularly monitor the performance of your materialized views. Over time, as data volumes grow or queries evolve, you may need to adjust the design of your materialized views.
