# Multi-Master Replication

Multi-Master Replication is a database replication model where multiple database nodes, known as masters, can perform read and **write** operations concurrently. Each master node propagates its data changes to every other master node, ensuring data consistency across the system. This model enhances scalability, availability, and performance but introduces complexities such as conflict resolution and increased configuration overhead.

## Architecture Overview

An illustrative diagram of a multi-master replication setup is as follows:

```
            +-------------------+
            |                   |
            |   Master Node 1   |
            |                   |
            +----+---------+----+
                 ^         ^
                 |         |
            Replication    | 
                 |         | 
                 |     Replication
                 |         |
                 v         v
+-------------------+   +-------------------+
|                   |   |                   |
|   Master Node 2   |<->|   Master Node 3   |
|                   |   |                   |
+----+---------+----+   +----+---------+----+
     ^         ^             ^         ^
     |         |             |         |

     |     Replication          |     Replication
     |         |                |         |
     v         v                v         v
+-------------------+   +-------------------+
|                   |   |                   |
|   Master Node 4   |   |   Master Node 5   |

In this diagram:

- Each master node is connected to every other master node through replication links.
- Data changes on any node are replicated to all other nodes.
- Clients can connect to any master node for both read and write operations.

## Key Characteristics

- **Concurrent Writes**: All master nodes can accept write operations simultaneously.
- **Data Consistency**: Changes made on one master are replicated to others to maintain consistency.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Mechanisms are required to handle conflicting updates due to concurrent writes.
- **High Availability**: The system remains operational even if one or more master nodes fail.

## Purpose of Multi-Master Replication

1. **Scalability of Write Operations**: Distributes write load across multiple nodes to handle higher transaction volumes.
2. **Enhanced High Availability**: Provides redundancy; if one master fails, others continue to operate.
3. **Geographical Distribution**: Reduces latency by allowing writes to the nearest master in geographically dispersed systems.
4. **Load Balancing**: Balances both read and write operations across multiple nodes for optimal resource utilization.

## Advantages

1. **Increased Write Scalability**: Supports higher write throughput by parallelizing write operations.
2. **Improved Fault Tolerance**: Eliminates single points of failure, enhancing system resilience.
3. **Reduced Latency**: Localized writes reduce the latency associated with remote database access.
4. **Better Resource Utilization**: Distributes workloads to prevent bottlenecks on a single node.

## Challenges

1. **Conflict Detection and Resolution**: Concurrent writes to the same data can cause conflicts that must be detected and resolved.
2. **Data Consistency Models**: Ensuring strong consistency across nodes can be complex and may impact performance.
3. **Increased Complexity**: Configuration, management, and monitoring are more complicated than single-master setups.
4. **Network Overhead**: Replicating data across multiple nodes increases network traffic.

## Conflict Resolution Strategies

- **Synchronous Replication**: Uses locking mechanisms to prevent conflicts but can reduce performance.
- **Asynchronous Replication with Conflict Detection**: Allows conflicts to occur but requires mechanisms to detect and resolve them after the fact.
- **Timestamp Ordering**: Resolves conflicts based on the timestamp of transactions.
- **Application-Level Handling**: Custom logic within the application to handle conflicts according to business rules.

## Example: Multi-Master Replication with MySQL and Galera Cluster

Galera Cluster is a synchronous multi-master replication plugin for MySQL and MariaDB databases. It ensures that transactions are committed on all nodes simultaneously, providing strong data consistency.

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian or CentOS/RHEL).
- **Database Software**: MySQL or MariaDB compatible with Galera.
- **Network Configuration**: All nodes must communicate over the network, with appropriate firewall settings.

### Setup and Configuration

#### 1. Installation

Install the database server and Galera Cluster on each master node.

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mariadb-server mariadb-client galera-3 rsync
```

**For CentOS/RHEL:**

```bash
sudo yum install mariadb-server mariadb-client galera rsync
```

> **Note:** Replace `mariadb` with `mysql` if you prefer MySQL over MariaDB.

#### 2. Configure the Database Server

Edit the configuration file, typically located at `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` or `/etc/my.cnf`.

Add or modify the following settings:

```ini
[mysqld]
# Basic Settings
bind-address=0.0.0.0
default-storage-engine=innodb
binlog_format=ROW
innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2

# Galera Provider Configuration
wsrep_on=ON
wsrep_provider=/usr/lib/galera/libgalera_smm.so

# Galera Cluster Configuration
wsrep_cluster_name="my_galera_cluster"
wsrep_cluster_address="gcomm://node1_ip,node2_ip,node3_ip"

# Node Specific Configuration
wsrep_node_name="nodeX"
wsrep_node_address="nodeX_ip"

# State Snapshot Transfer Method
wsrep_sst_method=rsync
```

- Replace `node1_ip`, `node2_ip`, `node3_ip` with the IP addresses of your master nodes.
- Replace `nodeX` and `nodeX_ip` with the hostname and IP address of the current node.

#### 3. Secure the Database

Run the following command to secure your database installation:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Follow the prompts to set a root password and remove anonymous users.

#### 4. Initialize the Cluster

On the **first node only**, bootstrap the cluster:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mysql
sudo galera_new_cluster
```

Alternatively, for older systems:

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop
sudo service mysql bootstrap
```

#### 5. Start MySQL on Other Nodes

On the remaining nodes, start the MySQL service normally:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mysql
```

Or for older systems:

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
```

#### 6. Verify Cluster Status

On any node, check the cluster size:

```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep_cluster_size';"
```

The result should reflect the total number of nodes in the cluster.

### Conflict Resolution Mechanism

Galera Cluster employs a certification-based replication mechanism:

1. **Transaction Processing**: Transactions execute optimistically without immediate concern for conflicts.
2. **Write-Set Creation**: Upon commit, a write-set (the data changes) is created.
3. **Replication**: The write-set is replicated to all nodes.
4. **Certification Test**: Each node performs a certification test to detect conflicts.
   - If no conflicts are found, the transaction is applied.
   - If conflicts exist, the transaction is aborted, and an error is returned.

#### How Conflicts are Detected

- **Transaction IDs**: Transactions are assigned Global Transaction IDs (GTIDs).
- **Version Checks**: The cluster checks if the rows affected have been altered since the transaction began.
- **Conflict Resolution**: If a conflict is detected, the transaction with the lower GTID (usually the later transaction) is rolled back.

#### Handling Conflicts in Applications

Applications should be designed to:

- **Retry Aborted Transactions**: Implement logic to retry transactions that fail due to conflicts.
- **Minimize Conflicts**: Design the database schema and access patterns to reduce the likelihood of conflicting writes.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Provide meaningful feedback to users when transactions fail.

### Testing the Cluster

- **Data Consistency Test**: Insert data on one node and verify it appears on others.
- **Conflict Test**: Attempt to write conflicting data on different nodes simultaneously to observe conflict resolution.
- **Failover Test**: Stop a node and ensure the cluster continues to operate without data loss.

## Best Practices

- **Monitor Cluster Health**: Use tools to monitor replication lag, node status, and network performance.
- **Network Configuration**: Ensure low-latency, reliable network connections between nodes.
- **Backup Strategies**: Regularly backup data, even in a multi-master setup.
- **Schema Changes**: Perform schema changes during maintenance windows and ensure compatibility across nodes.
