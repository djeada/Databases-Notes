**Example Usage in Redis:**

```bash
# Set key-value pairs
SET user123 "John Smith"
SET user456 "Jane Doe"

# Retrieve values
GET user123  # Returns "John Smith"
GET session789  # Returns {"id": 789, "user": "John Smith", "timestamp": "2024-09-14T12:34:56Z"}
```

Redis commands like `SET` and `GET` facilitate straightforward interactions with the key-value pairs, enabling rapid data manipulation and retrieval.

### Document Stores

Document stores manage data in **documents**, typically using formats like JSON, BSON, or XML. Each document contains semi-structured data that can vary in structure, allowing for **flexibility** in data modeling. Documents are grouped into **collections** within the database, which serve as logical groupings of related documents.

- The data model **stores** data in documents with nested structures, supporting complex data types and hierarchical relationships.
- Its schema-less nature allows each document to have a different **structure**, accommodating evolving data requirements without the need for predefined schemas.
- Document stores support rich **query** capabilities, including indexing, aggregation, and searching within nested fields, enhancing data retrieval efficiency.
- They are designed for horizontal **scalability**, allowing collections to grow and distribute across multiple servers seamlessly.
- Some document stores provide ACID **transactions** at the document level, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

#### Use Cases

  "email": "john@example.com",
  "orders": [
    {"id": 1, "product": "Laptop", "price": 1200},
    {"id": 2, "product": "Mouse", "price": 30}
  ],
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown",
    "zip": "12345"
  },
  "preferences": {
    "newsletter": true,
    "notifications": ["email", "sms"]
  }
}
```

- The `orders` field contains an array of **order** documents, allowing for multiple orders per user.
- The `address` and `preferences` fields demonstrate nested data structures, showcasing the ability to represent complex relationships within a single document.
- A dynamic **schema** allows additional fields to be added without affecting other documents, enabling flexible data evolution.

**Query Examples:**

```javascript
// Find user by ID
db.users.find({ "_id": "user123" })

// Retrieve users with orders over $1000
db.users.find({ "orders.price": { $gt: 1000 } })

// Update a user's email
db.users.update(
  { "_id": "user123" },
  { $set: { "email": "newemail@example.com" } }
)

// Add a new order to a user's orders
db.users.update(
  { "_id": "user123" },
  { $push: { "orders": { "id": 3, "product": "Keyboard", "price": 50 } } }
)
```

These queries demonstrate the powerful and flexible querying capabilities of document stores, enabling complex data manipulations and retrievals with ease.

### Column-Family Stores

#### Sample Data

| Row Key   | Column Family: **UserInfo**                             | Column Family: **UserOrders**                   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `user123` | `name: John`, `email: john@example.com`, `age: 30`      | `order1: Laptop`, `order2: Mouse`, `order3: Keyboard` |
| `user456` | `name: Jane`, `email: jane@example.com`, `age: 25`      | `order1: Keyboard`, `order2: Monitor`           |

Data is organized with a row key and column families like **UserInfo** and **UserOrders**, containing relevant columns. This structure allows for efficient querying and management of related data.

**CQL (Cassandra Query Language) Example:**

```sql
-- Create Keyspace with replication settings
CREATE KEYSPACE ecommerce WITH replication = {
  'class': 'SimpleStrategy',
  'replication_factor' : 3
};

-- Create Table with dynamic columns
CREATE TABLE ecommerce.users (
    user_id text PRIMARY KEY,
    name text,
    email text,
    age int,
    orders map<text, text>
);

-- Insert Data into the table
INSERT INTO ecommerce.users (user_id, name, email, age, orders)
VALUES (
  'user123',
  'John',
  'john@example.com',
  30,
  {'order1': 'Laptop', 'order2': 'Mouse', 'order3': 'Keyboard'}
);

INSERT INTO ecommerce.users (user_id, name, email, age, orders)
VALUES (
  'user456',
  'Jane',
  'jane@example.com',
  25,
  {'order1': 'Keyboard', 'order2': 'Monitor'}
);
```

This example demonstrates how column-family stores can efficiently handle dynamic and varied data structures, enabling flexible and scalable data management.

- **User**: `{ "id": 2, "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane@example.com" }`
- **Product**: `{ "id": 101, "name": "Laptop", "price": 1200 }`
- **Product**: `{ "id": 102, "name": "Mouse", "price": 30 }`

**Edges:**

- `(User:1)-[:FRIEND]->(User:2)` indicates John is friends with Jane.
- `(User:1)-[:PURCHASED]->(Product:101)` indicates John purchased a laptop.
- `(User:2)-[:PURCHASED]->(Product:102)` indicates Jane purchased a mouse.
- `(User:1)-[:LIKES]->(Product:102)` indicates John likes the mouse.

**Cypher Query Examples (Neo4j):**

```cypher
// Find friends of John
MATCH (john:User {name: 'John Smith'})-[:FRIEND]->(friend)
RETURN friend.name;

// Recommend products purchased by friends
MATCH (john:User {name: 'John Smith'})-[:FRIEND]->(friend)-[:PURCHASED]->(product)
RETURN DISTINCT product.name;

// Find users who have purchased the same product as John
MATCH (john:User {name: 'John Smith'})-[:PURCHASED]->(product)<-[:PURCHASED]-(other:User)
WHERE other.name <> 'John Smith'
RETURN other.name, product.name;

// Shortest path between two users
MATCH path = shortestPath((john:User {name: 'John Smith'})-[:FRIEND*]-(jane:User {name: 'Jane Doe'}))
RETURN path;
```

These queries demonstrate the power of graph databases in uncovering relationships, making recommendations, and analyzing network structures efficiently.
