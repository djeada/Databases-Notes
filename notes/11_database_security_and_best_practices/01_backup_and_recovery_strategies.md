## Backup and recovery strategies
Backup and recovery strategies are essential to ensure data durability and availability

## Types of Backups

### Full Backup
- Backs up the entire database, including data, schema, and metadata
- Requires the most storage space but provides the simplest recovery process

### Incremental Backup
- Backs up only the changes made since the last backup (full or incremental)
- Requires less storage space but has a more complex recovery process

### Differential Backup
- Backs up changes made since the last full backup
- Provides a balance between storage space and recovery complexity

## Recovery Strategies

### Point-in-Time Recovery
- Restores the database to a specific point in time using a combination of backups and transaction logs
- Requires careful planning and management of backup and transaction log files

### Continuous Data Protection
- Automatically captures and stores changes to the database in real-time or near-real-time
- Allows for faster recovery with minimal data loss

### Standby Databases
- Uses replication to maintain a copy of the primary database on one or more standby servers
- Provides redundancy and can be used for load balancing, reporting, or disaster recovery

## Best Practices
- Establish a backup schedule that meets the application's Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- Regularly test backups to ensure they can be successfully restored
- Store backups in multiple locations or use cloud storage for redundancy
- Monitor and maintain backup systems to ensure optimal performance and reliability
- Keep documentation of backup and recovery procedures up to date
- Implement security measures to protect backups from unauthorized access or tampering

## Tools and Technologies
- Database management systems (DBMS) often include built-in tools for backup and recovery
- Third-party tools are available for advanced backup and recovery features
- Cloud providers offer managed database services with automated backup and recovery options
