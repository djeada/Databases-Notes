## Real-life challenges
- Real-life challenges in database management involve various aspects of designing, implementing, and maintaining a database system
- Those include: scalability, data consistency, security, backup and recovery, and performance
- Additional challenges: deciphering data, dealing with legacy systems, understanding business requirements, and learning to ask the right questions

## Deciphering Data

### Cryptic Field Names
1. Interpreting and understanding data with unclear field names
2. Translating business requirements based on the actual data structure

### Data Cleaning and Structure
1. Transforming unstructured or poorly structured data into a usable format
2. Ensuring compliance with database normalization standards

## Legacy Systems

### Outdated or Inefficient Design
1. Working with databases that store multiple data points in one column
2. Identifying and understanding the purpose of legacy fields or systems

### Maintenance and Updates
1. Improving the design and structure of legacy systems while maintaining compatibility with existing applications
2. Addressing performance and scalability issues in older systems

## Understanding Business Requirements

### Communication with Stakeholders
1. Decoding requests from managers who use incorrect terminology
2. Collaborating with business analysts to clarify requirements

### Agile Development and Scrum
1. Adapting to an agile development environment with limited documentation
2. Balancing technical knowledge with understanding business needs and priorities

## Asking the Right Questions

### Estimation and Planning
1. Developing the ability to ask relevant questions to clarify requirements and expectations
2. Improving estimation skills for database-related tasks

### Continuous Improvement
1. Learning from experience to ask better questions and make better decisions
2. Adapting to changes in technology, business requirements, and industry best practices

## Best Practices
- Continuously observe and enhance database efficiency, safety, and coherence while refining dialogue with stakeholders, thus grasping and catering to their requirements more effectively. 
- Draw on past experiences to refine inquiries and elevate decision-making. 
- Keep a finger on the pulse of the latest trends and best practices within the database management realm. 
- Cooperate with stakeholders and users in tackling practical obstacles, augmenting the performance and dependability of database systems.
