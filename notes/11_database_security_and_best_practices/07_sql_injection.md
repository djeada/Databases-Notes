## SQL Injection Attacks

SQL Injection is a type of security vulnerability that arises when an attacker is capable of manipulating a SQL query using maliciously crafted user input.

## Occurrence of SQL Injection

SQL Injection typically takes place when software developers build dynamic database queries that include user-supplied input without proper sanitization or parameterization. The attacker introduces special characters or sequences, such as comments, in user input to alter the SQL query, potentially leading to unintended consequences.

## Vulnerability Example: Authentication Form

One common area where SQL Injection vulnerabilities are found is in user authentication forms. 

```javascript
let user = ORM.query(
  "SELECT * 
    FROM users 
    WHERE username = '#{params['username']}'
    AND password = '#{params['password']}';"
).execute()[0];

log_in_user(user)
```

In the above example, the application's SQL query includes user-provided input without any sanitization, leaving the application vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.

## Attack Types and Examples

### 1. Authentication Bypass

An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to log in as any user without knowing their password.

### 2. Data Destruction

By injecting malicious SQL commands, an attacker can modify or even destroy data in the database.

## Prevention Techniques

### Parameterized Queries

Parameterized queries force developers to first define all the SQL code and then pass each parameter to the query later. This allows the database to distinguish between code and data, regardless of the user input supplied, preventing SQL Injection.

### Stored Procedures

Stored procedures provide another layer of defense. They are predefined SQL queries that can be executed with different parameters, preventing the alteration of the query structure.

## Best Practices

- Research and implement SQL Injection prevention techniques specific to your ORM/database
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate SQL queries from data
- Keep SQL Injection in mind when performing code reviews
- Validate user input thoroughly, checking for type, length, format, and range
- Avoid directly incorporating unsanitized user input into SQL statements
- Implement multiple layers of validation to add more security depth
- Be cautious with functions that can execute commands or SQL queries, such as execute(), exe(), and others
