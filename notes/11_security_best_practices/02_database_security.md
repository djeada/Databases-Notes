# Database Security

Database security encompasses a range of measures designed to protect database management systems against compromises of their confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These measures are essential for safeguarding sensitive data, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and maintaining trust with stakeholders.

**Key Objectives of Database Security:**

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that sensitive data is accessible only to authorized users.
- **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle.
- **Availability**: Ensuring that authorized users have reliable access to data and database services when needed.

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. Effective authentication mechanisms are the first line of defense against unauthorized access.

### User Authentication

#### Strong Password Policies

- **Complexity Requirements**: Enforce passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Minimum Length**: Set a minimum password length (e.g., at least 12 characters).
- **Password Expiration**: Require users to change passwords regularly (e.g., every 90 days).
- **Password History**: Prevent reuse of previous passwords.
- **Account Lockout Policies**: Lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

**Example Configuration in PostgreSQL:**

```sql
ALTER ROLE username PASSWORD 'complex_password' VALID UNTIL 'expiration_date';
```

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Definition**: Requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access.
- **Factors**:
  - **Something You Know**: Password or PIN.
  - **Something You Have**: Security token, smart card, or mobile device.
  - **Something You Are**: Biometric verification (fingerprint, iris scan).

**Benefits:**

- Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.
- Adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain access.

### Connection Security

#### Secure Protocols (SSL/TLS)

- **Encryption**: Use SSL/TLS to encrypt data transmitted between clients and the database server.
- **Certificate Verification**: Ensure that certificates are properly signed and validated to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Illustrative Diagram:**

```
Client Application
       |
   Encrypted Connection (SSL/TLS)
       |
Database Server
```

**Example Configuration in MySQL:**

```ini
[mysqld]
ssl_ca=ca.pem
ssl_cert=server-cert.pem
ssl_key=server-key.pem
```

#### Limiting Direct Access

- **Restrict Access**: Limit the number of users and applications that can directly connect to the database.
- **Use Application Servers**: Employ application servers as intermediaries to manage connections and enforce security policies.
- **Firewall Rules**: Implement firewall rules to restrict access to database ports from unauthorized IP addresses.

## Authorization

Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. Proper authorization ensures users can access only the data and functions necessary for their roles.

### Principle of Least Privilege

- **Definition**: Grant users the minimal level of access—or permissions—needed to perform their job functions.
- **Implementation**:
  - **User Permissions**: Assign specific permissions rather than broad or default ones.
  - **Regular Audits**: Periodically review and adjust permissions as roles change.
  - **Separation of Duties**: Divide tasks and privileges among multiple users to prevent fraud and errors.

**Example in SQL Server:**

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON database.schema.table TO username;
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Definition**: Assign permissions to roles rather than individual users, and then assign users to roles.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies management of user permissions.
  - Enhances security by ensuring consistent permission assignments.
  - Facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Illustrative Diagram:**

```
[ Roles ]
   |
   +----------------+
   |                |
[ User A ]     [ User B ]
```

**Example in Oracle Database:**

```sql
CREATE ROLE data_entry_role;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO data_entry_role;
GRANT data_entry_role TO user1, user2;
```

## Data Encryption

Encryption protects data by converting it into a coded format that can only be read with the appropriate decryption key.

### Data at Rest

- **Definition**: Data stored on physical media (e.g., database files, backups, logs).
- **Encryption Methods**:
  - **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)**: Encrypts database files at the file system level.
  - **File System Encryption**: Use OS-level encryption tools like BitLocker or LUKS.
  - **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)**: Securely store encryption keys in hardware devices.

**Key Management Practices:**

- **Secure Key Storage**: Store encryption keys separately from encrypted data.
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly change encryption keys to minimize exposure.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to encryption keys to authorized personnel only.

**Example in SQL Server:**

```sql
-- Enable TDE
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'strong_password';
CREATE CERTIFICATE tdeCert WITH SUBJECT = 'TDE Certificate';
CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY WITH ALGORITHM = AES_256 ENCRYPTION BY SERVER CERTIFICATE tdeCert;
ALTER DATABASE database_name SET ENCRYPTION ON;
```

### Data in Transit

- **Definition**: Data moving between client applications and the database server.
- **Encryption Protocols**:
  - **SSL/TLS**: Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security.
  - **SSH Tunneling**: Secure Shell tunneling for encrypting network services.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Force Encrypted Connections**: Configure the database to accept only encrypted connections.
  - **Certificate Management**: Use valid and trusted SSL certificates.

**Example in PostgreSQL:**

```conf
# postgresql.conf
ssl = on
ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'
ssl_key_file = 'server.key'
```

## Monitoring and Auditing

Continuous monitoring and auditing help detect and respond to security incidents promptly.

### Database Activity Monitoring (DAM)

- **Definition**: Tools and processes that monitor, capture, and analyze database activity.
- **Functions**:
  - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Observe database transactions as they occur.
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns that may indicate a security threat.
  - **Alerting**: Generate alerts for suspicious activities.

**Implementation Methods:**

- **Agent-Based Monitoring**: Install agents on database servers to capture activity.
- **Network-Based Monitoring**: Use network taps or spans to monitor database traffic.

**Example Tools:**

- **IBM Guardium**
- **Imperva SecureSphere**
- **Oracle Audit Vault**

### Auditing

- **Definition**: Systematic examination of records and activities to ensure compliance with policies and regulations.
- **Audit Trails**:
  - **Login Attempts**: Successful and failed authentication attempts.
  - **Data Access**: Records of who accessed or modified data.
  - **Privilege Changes**: Modifications to user roles and permissions.

**Best Practices:**

- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review audit logs for signs of unauthorized activity.
- **Retention Policies**: Determine how long to retain audit logs based on compliance requirements.
- **Secure Storage**: Protect audit logs from tampering by storing them securely.

**Example in MySQL:**

```sql
-- Enable general query log
SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';
SET GLOBAL log_output = 'FILE';
```

## Additional Security Practices

### Data Masking

- **Definition**: Replacing sensitive data with fictitious but realistic data.
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Non-Production Environments**: Protect sensitive data in development, testing, or training environments.
  - **Data Sharing**: Safely share data with third parties without exposing confidential information.

**Techniques:**

- **Static Data Masking**: Mask data in a copy of the database.
- **Dynamic Data Masking**: Mask data on-the-fly as queries are executed.

**Example in SQL Server:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID int IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName varchar(100) MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'default()'),
    LastName varchar(100) MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'default()'),
    SSN char(11) MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'partial(1,"XXXXXX",4)'),
    Email varchar(100) MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'email()')
);
```

### Patch Management

- **Definition**: Regularly updating software to fix vulnerabilities and bugs.
- **Best Practices**:
  - **Regular Updates**: Keep the database software and underlying OS up-to-date.
  - **Testing**: Test patches in a non-production environment before deployment.
  - **Change Management**: Follow a formal process for applying patches.

### Network Segmentation

- **Definition**: Dividing a network into segments to control traffic flow and enhance security.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Isolation**: Keep the database server in a secure subnet inaccessible from public networks.
  - **Access Control**: Use firewalls and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict traffic.
  - **Containment**: Limit the spread of breaches within the network.

**Illustrative Diagram:**

     |
[ Firewall ]
     |
[ Application Servers ]
     |
[ Database Servers ] (Isolated Subnet)
