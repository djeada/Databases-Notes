## Capacity planning
Capacity planning involves estimating the resources required to meet the demands of an application or system

## Goals of Capacity Planning
### Ensure adequate performance
Provide sufficient resources to maintain acceptable response times and throughput

### Optimize resource utilization
Allocate resources efficiently to minimize waste and control costs

### Support future growth
Anticipate and plan for increased demand to avoid capacity-related bottlenecks or downtime

## Factors Affecting Capacity

### User demand
Number of concurrent users, transaction rates, data volume, and access patterns

### Application architecture
System design, including algorithms, data structures, and communication patterns

### Infrastructure
Hardware and software components, such as servers, storage, and network devices

### Resource constraints
Budget, available equipment, or other limitations

## Capacity Forecasting

### Historical data
Analyze past usage trends to identify patterns or predict future demand

### Benchmarking
Conduct performance tests to measure system capacity under various workloads

### Modeling
Develop mathematical or simulation models to estimate capacity requirements based on user demand, system behavior, and resource constraints

## Best Practices
- Establish a capacity planning process that includes regular monitoring, forecasting, and resource allocation
- Monitor system performance and resource utilization to identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement
- Use monitoring tools and data analytics to automate data collection and analysis
- Plan for peak demand periods and build in a buffer for unexpected spikes in usage
- Review and update capacity plans periodically to account for changes in user demand, application architecture, or infrastructure
- Consider using cloud-based or elastic infrastructure to scale resources dynamically based on demand
