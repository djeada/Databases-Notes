## Database migration
Database migration involves moving data, schema, and other database components from one system to another

## Reasons for Database Migration

###  Technology upgrade
Migrate to a newer version of a database or a different database management system (DBMS)

###  Infrastructure change
Move from on-premises to cloud-based infrastructure or between cloud providers

###  Performance improvement
Optimize performance by adopting a different database architecture or scaling resources

###  Cost reduction
Reduce costs by moving to a more cost-effective platform or consolidating databases

## Migration Strategies

###  Big Bang Migration
- Complete the migration in a single, coordinated effort
- Requires significant planning and testing, and may involve downtime

###  Parallel Migration
- Run the old and new systems concurrently during the migration process
- Allows for a smoother transition and reduces the risk of downtime, but requires additional resources

###  Phased Migration
- Migrate the database in stages, moving components or subsets of data incrementally
- Minimizes risk and allows for testing and validation at each stage, but may take longer to complete

## Migration Steps
1. Assess the current database environment, including data, schema, and dependencies
2. Plan the migration process, including the choice of migration strategy and required resources
3. Prepare the target environment, including hardware, software, and configuration settings
4. Develop and test migration scripts or tools to move data, schema, and other components
5. Execute the migration, ensuring data integrity and consistency throughout the process
6. Validate the migrated data and functionality, and address any issues or discrepancies
7. Monitor and optimize the new environment to ensure performance and stability

## Additional Steps for a Safe Migration
###  Schedule a Backup
Perform a full backup of the current database before starting the migration process

###  Restore from Backup
Test the restoration of the backup on the new environment to ensure data integrity and availability

###  Run a Diff
Compare the current running database with the restored database from backup to identify any new records or discrepancies

###  Sync New Records
If new records are identified during the diff, synchronize them between the old and new databases to ensure data consistency

###  Decommission Old Database
Once the new database has been confirmed to be functioning properly, decommission the old database to avoid confusion and reduce resource consumption

## Best Practices
- Perform a thorough assessment of the current and target environments to identify potential challenges or risks
- Develop a detailed migration plan, including timelines, resources, and contingencies
- Test the migration process thoroughly, using realistic data and workloads
- Communicate with stakeholders and users throughout the migration process, and provide support and training as needed
- Monitor the new environment closely after the migration to identify and address any issues or performance bottlenecks
- Consider using specialized migration tools or consulting services to facilitate the migration process
