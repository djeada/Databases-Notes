      +----------------+
      | Old Database   |<--+
      +----------------+   |
             ^              |
             | Synchronization
             v              |
      +----------------+   |
      | New Database   |---+
      +----------------+

Users can access both databases during migration.
```

### Phased Migration

**Definition:**

- Migrate the database in stages, moving components or subsets of data incrementally.

**Characteristics:**

- **Advantages:**
  - Reduces risk by allowing testing and validation at each stage.
  - Minimal impact on users due to gradual transition.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Longer total migration time.
  - Requires careful coordination to ensure consistency.
