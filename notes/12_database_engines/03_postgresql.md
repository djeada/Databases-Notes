column_name2 datatype NOT NULL,
...
);
```

### Inserting Data

```
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

### Querying Data

```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Updating Data

```
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
