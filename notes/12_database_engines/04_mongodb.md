## MongoDB
- MongoDB: a popular, open-source, NoSQL database management system
- Document-oriented, using BSON (Binary JSON) format for data storage
- Designed for scalability, high availability, and high performance
- Suitable for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large-scale enterprise systems

## Features

###  Schemaless
No fixed schema; documents can have different fields and structures

###  Horizontal Scalability
Supports sharding for distributing data across multiple servers

### High Availability
Supports replica sets for automatic failover and redundancy

### Indexing
Allows indexing on any field, including embedded documents and arrays

###  Aggregation Framework
Provides powerful data processing and analytics capabilities

### Text Search
Built-in support for full-text search and indexing

### GridFS
Supports storage and retrieval of large files using a distributed file system

## MongoDB Commands
A. Creating a Database
```
use database_name;
```
B. Creating Collections
```
db.createCollection("collection_name");
```
C. Inserting Data
```
db.collection_name.insert({
field1: value1,
field2: value2,
...
});
```
D. Querying Data
```
db.collection_name.find({
field: value
});
```
E. Updating Data
